A central, ornately decorated and golden pavilion or altar stands prominently on the cloud.  Long staffs or banners are positioned around the structure, as if placed there by unseen hands. Beams of bright light radiate outward from above the pavilion.  Many birds, in various colors, fly freely around the cloud and the central structure.  Red and orange petals fall abundantly from the sunny sky above. The background is a bright, sunny sky. The overall scene is bright and ethereal, suggesting a heavenly or celestial setting,",

      "caption_prompt": "A stylized 3D-rendered image of an androgynous young person with a light skin tone and long, straight deep muted indigo hair with subtle purple undertones, styled in a topknot. The headwear, also deep muted indigo metal, is made of metal and features a sharp, angular design. He possesses short, Chinese-style dragon horns that are shorter than his ears. His expression is serious, and a small, cloud-shaped mark, the same deep muted indigo as his hair, adorns his forehead. He has a noticeably slender and elongated body and a somewhat round face. He is clad in a long, flowing white robe with delicate light blue detailing and trim. This robe boasts wide sleeves and appears to be crafted from a silky or satin-like material. The detailing includes swirling patterns and stylized script along the edges of the robe. A light blue sash cinches the waist. His left hand is extended in an open palm, while his right fist is clenched and rests against his left palm in a traditional Chinese martial arts greeting. Dark gray shoes or boots are visible beneath the robe",

        "像素": "The image is a vibrant piece of pixel art depicting a knight in shining armor standing in a surreal, glowing forest. The pixel style is distinctly 8-bit, with blocks of color clearly visible in the knight's armor, the foliage, and the fantastical mushrooms that populate the forest floor.  The low resolution contributes to the retro video game aesthetic, evident in the limited color palette and the distinct square shapes of all elements. The contrast between the sharply defined pixels and the smooth gradients of color used in the background creates a unique visual effect. The overall pixelation is consistent throughout the image, reinforcing the retro style and adding to its charm.",

The capsule sits playfully on a surface resembling a sandy beach with faint wave marks.

        "插画": "##  Celestial Echoes: A Vintage Anime Style Guide\n\nThis style evokes the nostalgic charm of early to mid-80s anime, specifically focusing on the distinctive cel-shaded aesthetic and a color palette inspired by the limitations—and subsequently, the unique beauty—of the era.\n\n**Lineart:**  The linework is paramount. It's characterized by a confident, slightly uneven hand, suggesting the organic imperfections of hand-drawn animation. Lines are bold and often vary in thickness, with thicker lines outlining major forms and thinner lines used for details and shading.  There's a distinct lack of digital precision; think of the slight wobbles and tremors a human hand would impart.  Cross-hatching is employed sparingly, mostly for shadow definition in darker areas, and it's intentionally slightly messy, never perfectly uniform.\n\n**Color Palette:** The color scheme is predominantly composed of a limited number of rich, saturated hues. Think deep blues, vibrant reds, earthy greens, and warm oranges.  Avoid pastels or overly bright, neon colors.  A subtle cel-shading effect is achieved by using distinct blocks of color with minimal blending. There's a gentle gradation between light and shadow areas, often achieved through varying shades within a single color family rather than harsh color shifts.  The overall effect should be slightly muted, with a hint of a faded, almost vintage photographic quality.\n\n**Character Design:**  Characters should possess exaggerated features,  drawing inspiration from classic shojo and shonen styles. Large, expressive eyes are crucial, often outlined with thick, black lines and featuring a distinct shine or highlight.  Hair is voluminous and stylized, with attention to detail in strands and flow.  Clothing is often simple yet evocative, typically consisting of flowing robes, sharp-shouldered jackets, or other garments with clean, bold silhouettes.  Avoid overly intricate or detailed clothing patterns.\n\n**Backgrounds:** Backgrounds typically feature minimal detail but maintain a strong sense of atmosphere.  Use a combination of flat color blocks, simple linear perspective, and sparse but suggestive details (e.g., a few stylized trees, a distant mountain range outlined against the sky).  Focus on establishing mood rather than photorealistic representation.  Think hazy skies, dramatic sunsets, or the soft glow of moonlight.\n\n**Texturing:**  Minimal texturing is employed.  Avoid complex gradients or overly detailed shading.  Instead, rely on the contrast between solid color blocks and linework to create depth and form.  A slight \"grain\" or texture could be added subtly in post-processing to further enhance the vintage feel, mimicking the texture of old film or cel animation.\n\n**Overall Mood:** The overall mood should be evocative of classic anime storytelling, conveying a blend of drama, romance, or adventure through a combination of visual storytelling and character expression.  This is a style that should feel nostalgic and inviting; it should whisper stories of brave heroes, powerful villains, and fantastical adventures.",

Some diversified colors are allowed to enhance the visual appeal. The figures are small and cute, and the overall style is whimsical and charming. The card is heavily embellished with glitter, adding to the dreamy atmosphere. The scene is a wave-themed diorama. The layered papercut waves are various shades of blue, with white paper accents mimicking foam and sea spray. Small paper and ribbon fish, embellished with glitter, swim amongst the waves.

Elements must be mini and created by edible foods only and always kept INSIDE the bento box. If provided, incorporate a scene/environment OUTSIDE of the box. Make it such that the box sits on a table in that location. The overall style is whimsical and charming, with a focus on soft, pastel colors and delicate details. The lighting is soft and diffused, enhancing the delicate textures and colors. The final product should show ONLY a close up of the exquisite bento box sitting on a surface of a given location."
